# SATutor

## About the App:
SATutor is a free app to help students improve their vocabulary in preparation for the Verbal portion of the SAT I. It is built on a spaced-repeitition algorithm to optimize a student's capacity to memorize new words without forgetting the words they have previously learned. The general concept behind the algorithm is that students need to revisit words that they learn periodically, so that they solidify their understanding. It was developed to counteract the general forgetting curve. SATutor will do all the work in terms of determining when a student should revisit a word they previously learned in order to not forget it.
